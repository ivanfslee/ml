Machine Learning - A Quick Example

    A high level overview on how we would
        use ML to approach a problem.

    Problem:

        You are an analyst at a small city
        with a flooding problem.

        City Manager asks you:
            'If it rains 240mm this year, 
            how much flood damage will
            there be?'

    // Describe our overall 5 step problem solving process for this course
    Problem Solving Process:

        - Identify data that is relevant to the problem

        - Assemble a set of data related to the problem 
            you are trying to solve

        - Decide on the type of output you are predicting

        - Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that 
            will determine a correlation between your
            'features' and 'labels'

        - Use model generated by algorithm to make a
            prediction
    
    //What are features and labels? 
    //How are they related?
    Feature vs. Labels 
        'feature' = independent variable
        'label' = dependent variable

        If the amount of 'annual rainfall' (independent variable, 'feature')
            changes, we will probably see a change in 
            'flood damage costs' (dependent variable, 'label').

        So in terms of relevant data, we probably want to look
            at amount of rainfall in a given year along
            with the flood damage costs for that year.

    //
    Datasets
        In the real world, we almost never get nice datasets
            that are nicely formatted.

        In this course, we need to understand how we can 
            collect data, assemble it all together, format it,
            and use that to make some type of prediction
            using machine learning.

    Procuring Data

        If data was not given to us in a nice spreadsheet/csv file
            we might comb through headlines/youtube videos/magazines.

        ...250 mm of rainfall last year - newspaper 2009
        ...197mm and 274mm rainfall - youtube video 2011
        ...291mm rain - weather.com 

        For the budget/flood damage cost we might go
            and reference a city budget.

            Report: Budget of Cityville since 2008

        We take those sources of data and aggregate them into a table:

              Total Rainfall (mm)    Flood Damage (million $)
        2008        250                     2.1
        2009        197                     1.2
        2010        274                     2.5
        2011        291                     5.3
        2012        136                     0
        2013        306                     6.2

        We can consider the above dataset that relates
            our independent variable of total rainfall ('feature')
            to our dependent variable of flood damage costs ('label')
